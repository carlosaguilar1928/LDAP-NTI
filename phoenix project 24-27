Finally after John accepts that his ways of running security are clogging the 
resources of the company he decides to ask Bill to join him in a meeting with Dick. 
Dick is the right hand man of Steve the CEO of the company and through the interview
he reveals what his goals are for the company. Steve and John decide to find out what
department are in charge of tackling those goals and what resources they require from IT. 
Also, they begin to make plans for creating a preventive maintenance system that will
help those resources maintain their integrity.

John also begins to dissect the reason why they audit was able to pass without his help. 
He finds that they audit system was far more complex than just setting rules in IT.
He begins to understand that there are other department and factors in the production 
environment that could be used to potentially leverage and unload the burden of the IT department.
He then proposes to create a new security system that maximizes on these findings. 
Also,  Bill realizes that the time between sales planning and delivery is currently 
far to long and needs to be shortened down. Core Business Projects depending on IT should be
able to depend on fast IT reliability. For this he proposes that him and Chris “the development manager” 
create faster, short term deployment on what is required. Thus avoiding the fiasco of a three year
deployment such as Phoenix that in the end did not even cover necessary features.
