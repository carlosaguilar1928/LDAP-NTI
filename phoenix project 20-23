      After getting mentoring from Erik and taking a look at the MPR-8 factory they decide 
that before the job-freeze lifts they need to organize their types of works into work centers.
Patty creates a KanBan using index cards to granularize a few known projects and begin tracking 
them effectively. She labels the projects into 3 parts called “Ready”, “Doing”, “Done”. 

	    Finally, they realize that due to Brent being overwhelmed by a mistake in planning
  they have allowed him to enter into a project that was far above its estimated requirements. 
  Bill, then proposes to create wait times in order to fully analyze the projects and determine
  a realistic amount of resources required. They wait time should be calculated by dividing 
  the percentage of time busy by the percentage of time waiting for resource to be accumulated “idle time”. 
  This idle time also needs to be expedited and currently there is no process in place to manage it. 
  So, Pat proposes to have a “water boy” or person who’s jobs is to deliver resources and projects 
  from work center to work center in order to help expedite processes.
