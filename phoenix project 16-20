In this chapter, after a major confrontation between our protagonist and His boss. 
They reconcile and begin to realize that IT is not just another department but it’s 
the main issue to be fixed in order to create a working company. There must be a balance
between other departments who’s main priority is business operations and the
underlying IT infrastructure making it all happen

	Bill, proposes a work freeze in order to stop work orders from piling up and getting
  the existing load down. Also, allowing operations to catch up with developments. 
  Erick also begins to mentor Bill on how Brent is not a work center and only a worker. 
  He  begins to realize that in order to get to a point where they can keep up he 
  must stop Brent from working in multiple workcenters at once, and must train 
  other workers and document work performed. This will enable them to spend so 
  much time in unplanned work and create the ability to actually perform planned work. 
  Lastly, he must learn to deal with John since his department does not offer a single 
  performance boost to the entire company and only provides clogging. 
  Nevertheless, John’s department still has an important role in maintaining the company within regulations.
